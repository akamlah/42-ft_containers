# 42-ft_containers
Some of the c++98 STL containers recoded from scratch for learning purposes: vector, map, stack and set



### TESTING

The folder 'testbench' provides extensive unit tests for each container, written during the development. The tests can be built and excuted with 'make':
* 'make std' compiles the tests using the STL containers
* 'make' compiles using the containers in this project
* 'make comp' executes both of the above and redirects the outputs to files and then prints the diff to stdout
